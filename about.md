  <b>Church is a family, not a building!</b> We're a welcoming Christian church based on the corner of Canning Road and Milton Street. We believe Jesus is the hope for the world and we want to share that real and lasting joy with you.

## What we're about

We believe in [God](#about-god). The good news is that God is **pursuing you**, because you're his child. We got separated from God a long time ago, but now he desparately wants you back, like a Father who longs for his child. We are here to help you find your way back to Dad.
