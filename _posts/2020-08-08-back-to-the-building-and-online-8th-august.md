## Back to the building

We are heading back to the building for Sunday 9th August, in a way that we believe will keep us all safe! We can accomodate 21 households (people who sit together), and if you're on the church address list, you will have received a letter asking whether you think you'll come along. If you don't usually come along, we will prioritise trying to fit you in as a guest... even if some of the regulars have to come back later ðŸ˜‰

We are going to meet every 2 weeks to start with.

**The key thing** we want you to remember as we follow COVID measures is that we should see this as a way to **love our neighbours**, that is the entire community, by following the guidance well. We will be held to a high standard by the public and we should seek to be excellent in this.

Later in this post we'll list the entire set of guidance to follow, but in short:

 + Don't come before 10:20am
 + Wear a mask
 + Use the hand sanitizer
 + Follow the one way system
 + Sit between the crosses of tape
 + Keep your kids close with you
 + Chat outside, after the service, and keep 2m when you do!

## Sunday Online

We will be filming the talk and the prayers from the service, cutting it together with the same worship videos shown on Sunday morning, and broadcasting this for you on the same day that the church meets in the morning.

**We'll premiere the video at 6pm as usual** and it will appear here when ready!

### Entering the building

 + No tea, coffee or biscuits will be served after the church service.
 + All doors will be propped open for the duration of the service to keep sufficient airflow through the building and to reduce the chance of transmission through the touching of door handles. Be aware it could be chilly.

 + The steward will wear gloves and a mask while serving the bread and wine
