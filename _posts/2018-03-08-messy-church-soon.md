This Saturday, we are doing Messy Church with a focus on Mothers' Day! There will be loads of opportunities for kids to make crafts for their Mums, and we will also be hearing all about what it was like to be the mother of history's most important man...

Anyone can come and join us (kids should be accompanied by an adult). There will be fun, food, and messy stuff to do. Please come along and see what we're up to, on Saturday 10th March at 4pm!
