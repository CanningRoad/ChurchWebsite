Every year we hold a Carols by Candlelight service on the weekend before Christmas. This year it will be on the 17th of December.

The service is an atmospheric ocassion, with a mix of old and new carols, and bible readings. Everyone enjoys it a lot, we always have Christmassy snacks (mince pies, mulled wine), and we love to dress the church up in all the trimmings!

Christmas is about Jesus - God, born for us on Earth to live perfectly and show us the way back to our Heavenly Father. So come and join the celebration of a God so good that He humbled himself to being born in a feeding trough!
