## Our first indoor picnic of 2018

From time to time, we like to share lunch together as a church. There are loads of good reasons to do this, like:

 * Showing and sharing generosity
 * Building up an interest and a care in one another's lives
 * Learning how we can help to pray and support each other
 
Not to mention the fact that Jesus almost always got to know people over a meal! It's clear that God has made meal times not just to keep us alive, but to keep us in community.

God's church is a magnetic community of people who should treat one another with exceeding and growing love. Next time we hold an indoor picnic we want to make sure that we bring as many of our friends and neighbours into that magnetic community as we possibly can.

So now, we're making a regular thing of it! We will be holding a [Bring & Share lunch on the third Sunday of every month][lunch].

Sandwiches, pasties, and pizzas... but lunch is much more than that! Get in touch if you want to know about our next indoor picnic! You can find us on [Twitter @Canning_Road][twitter] and on [Facebook][facebook].
