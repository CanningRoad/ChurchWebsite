## 2017 Carols by Candlelight service in review

It was lovely to see so many of our old and new friends come along to our candlelit carol service. We all had a great time in the warm and festive surroundings, and it was a joy to kick Christmas off with true songs of how God showed his goodness by being born for us on Earth.

The [New Generation][newgen] kids did an awesome job with their performance of Away in a Manger, and it was great to have their families there too.

To finish off we all enjoyed Gluvine and mince pies which the youth were really good to volunteer to serve to everyone!

Here's hoping that next year we can invite even more of our friends and neighbours to enjoy singing into Christmas with us.
