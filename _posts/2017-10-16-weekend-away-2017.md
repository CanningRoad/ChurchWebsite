title: Weekend away 2017
---

At the beginning of October, around twenty of us from the church went to Thornleigh Christian Centre in Grange-over-Sands for our annual weekend away. We had a really nice time together, sharing meals and getting teaching from Stuart and Katherine, who have been missionaries in many different countries.

We talked about different ways we can all reach out individually and as a church family to share the good news about Jesus and to help our community in His name. On our free afternoon on Saturday, people enjoyed hill walking and a spot of shopping in and about Grange. Getting to know everyone better and learning about each other's lives, means that we can care more, and that's a really great thing.

We're looking forward to next year - but we're also looking forward to what God can do with us in the meantime!

Our family is wide open - come and join us for a Sunday morning meeting and get to know this funny bunch.
