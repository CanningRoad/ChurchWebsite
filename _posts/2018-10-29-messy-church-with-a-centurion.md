title: Messy Church with a Centurion!
---

On Saturday 10th November, we are doing Messy Church, looking at the story of Jesus and the Centurion (that's a Roman Solider). We will be making crafts, singing songs, and hearing what this soldier thought Jesus could do for him...

Anyone can come and join us (kids should be accompanied by an adult). There will be fun, food, and messy stuff to do. Please come along and see what we're up to, on **Saturday 10th November at 4pm**!
