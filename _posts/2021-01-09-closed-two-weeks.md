Due to icy conditions, and the Government's latest advice to "Stay at Home", the Elders have decided it's safest that Canning Road be closed for the next two Sundays (10th and 17th of January).

There will be no stream from us this week, but we encourage you to try the Sunday content from our friends at [Christ Church Southport][CCS] and [St Simons and St Judes][SSJ] who are based round the corner in High Park.

Have a peaceful weekend!
