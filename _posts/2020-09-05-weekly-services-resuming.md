## Regular Services

For the last month we've had services every two weeks, but we're now confident enough that from this Sunday (6th September) we are resuming Sunday services every week at 10:30am.

We can accomodate 21 households (people who sit together). If you don't usually come along, we will prioritise fitting you in... even if some of the regulars have to come back later ðŸ˜‰

Let's remember to carefully follow COVID guidance as a way to **love our neighbours**. Here's the short version of the guidance again:

 + Don't come before 10:20am
 + Wear a mask
 + Use the hand sanitizer
 + Follow the one way system
 + Sit between the crosses of tape
 + Keep your kids close with you
 + Chat outside, after the service, and keep 2m when you do!

Thanks for your patience, we hope you can join us!

## Sundays Online

We're going to continue filming the talks and prayers from the service, cutting it together with the worship videos shown on Sunday morning, and broadcasting this for you in the days following the service.

You can take a look at the [Canning Road YouTube Channel](
