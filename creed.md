longname: What we believe
---

Hi! This is a bit of a long read, but we think it's important to back up what we believe with God's Word in the Bible. So underneath, you can find all the important things that we (as a church) think are true, and you can look them up in the Bible if you want to.

## God

We believe in the one living and true God, the maker and preserver of all things. In the unity of the Godhead there are three co-equal persons; the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. These three are one in eternity, deity and purpose; everlasting, of infinite power, wisdom and goodness.

 > Ge 1:1-2; Ex 3:13-15; Dt 6:4; Mt 28:19; Jn 1:1-3; 5:19-23; 8:58; 14:9-11; 15:26; 16:13-15; 2Cor 13:14

We believe that God is the creator of all that exists whether of matter or spirit. He made man to bear his image and by intention he relates to man as Father, thereby forever declaring his goodwill toward man. He is, according to the New Testament, the one who both seeks and receives penitent sinners.

 > Ge 1:26-27; Ps 103:13-14; Is 40:28-29; 64:8; Mt 6:8; Lk 15:11-32; Jn 4:23; 1Jn 1:3


We believe that God was himself in Jesus Christ to reconcile man to God. Conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, Jesus of Nazareth was God in human flesh, truly God and truly man, yet without sin. For us the Son of God suffered, was crucified, died and was buried. He poured out his life as a blameless sacrifice for our sin and transgressions. We gratefully acknowledge that he is our Saviour, the one perfect mediator between God and man.

 > Mt 1:21; 20:28; 26:27-28; Lk 1:35; 19:10; Jn 1:1; 1:10, 1:14; 2Cor 5:18-19; Php 2:5-8; 1Tim 2:5; Heb 2:17; 9:14-15


We believe that Jesus Christ is risen victorious from the dead. His resurrected body became more glorious and not hindered by human limitations. He ascended into heaven where he sits as our exalted Lord at the right hand of God the Father and where he intercedes for us until all his enemies are brought into complete subjection. He will return to judge all men. Every knee will bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

 > Mt 25:31-32; Lk 24:1-7; 24:39; Jn 20:19; Ac 1:9-11; 2:24; Ro 8:33-34; 2Cor 5:10; Php 2:9-11; Heb 1:1-4


We believe that the Holy Spirit is the third person of the Trinity. He is one with the Father and the Son, the eternal Godhead; equal in deity, majesty and power. He is God effective in creation, in life and in the church. The incarnation and ministry of Jesus were accomplished by the Holy Spirit. He continues to reveal, interpret and glorify the Son.

 > Mt 28:19; Jn 4:24; 14:16-17; 14:26; 15:26; 16:13-15


We believe that the Holy Spirit acts in our conviction, regeneration, sanctification and glorification. He indwells, assures and enables the believer.

 > Jn 16:7-8; Ac 15:8-9; Ro 8:9; 8:14-16; 1Cor 3:16; 2Cor 3:17-18; Gal 4:6


We believe that the Holy Spirit is poured out upon all believers by the Father as requested by the Son. He bestows the love of God and makes real the lordship of Jesus Christ in the believer so that both his gifts of words and service may achieve the common good and build and increase the church. In relation to the world he is the Spirit of truth and his instrument is the Word of God.

 > Jn 14:16; Ro 8:14; 1Cor 12:4-7; 2Pe 1:21


## Scriptures

We believe that the Holy Scriptures are God's record, uniquely inspired by the Holy Spirit. They have been faithfully recorded by holy men of God, without error, as moved by the Holy Spirit, and subsequently transmitted without corruption of any essential doctrine. They are the authoritative record of God's acts in creation, in history, in our salvation, and especially in his Son, Jesus Christ. We believe that this written Word of God fully reveals the will of God concerning man in all things necessary to salvation and Christian living, so that whatever is not found therein, nor can be proved thereby, is not to be required of one as an article of faith or necessary for salvation. We believe that all Scripture is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the Christian may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. We believe that Scripture is complete and that nothing must be added to it or taken away from it.

 > Deut 4:2; 28:9; Ps 19:7-11; Jn 14:26; 17:17; Ro 15:4; 2Ti 3:14-17; Heb 4:12; Jas 1:21; Rev 22:18-19


Both Testaments bear witness to God's will for his people. The Old Testament ancient laws for ceremonies and rites, and the civil regulations for the nation of Israel are not necessarily binding on Christians today because of the new covenant in Jesus Christ. But, by the example of Jesus, we know that God still requires us to obey the moral commandments of the Old Testament.

 > Mt 5:17-18; Lk 10:25-28; Jn 5:39; 5:46-47; Ac 10:43; Gal 3:1-25; Gal 5:3-4; 1Pe 1:10-12


We believe that the New Testament is not contrary to the Old. The New Testament fulfils and interprets the Old. It is the record of the revelation of God in Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit. It is God's final word regarding man, his sin and his salvation, the world and destiny.

 > Mt 24:35; Mk 8:38; Jn 14:24; Heb 2:1-4; 2Pe 1:16-21; 1Jn 2:2-6; Rev 21:5; 22:19


## Man

We believe that God created man in his own image, innocent, with a moral understanding and responsible to choose between good and evil, right and wrong. By the sin of Adam, man as the offspring of Adam is corrupted in his very nature. He is unable by his own strength and work to restore himself to a right relationship with God and to merit eternal salvation. God, the Omnipotent, provides all the resources of the Trinity to make it possible for man to respond to his grace through faith in Jesus Christ as Saviour and Lord. By God's grace and help man is enabled to do good works with a free will.

 > Ge 1:27; Ps 51:5; 130:3; Ro 3:23-24; 5:17-19; Eph 2:8-10


We believe that God's law for all human life, spiritual, personal and social, is expressed in two divine commands: Love the Lord your God with all your heart, and love your neighbour as yourself. These commands reveal what is required by God and is best for man in his relationship to God and to other men. They recognise God as the only Sovereign and set forth the principles of human duty in both individual and social action. All men are created by him and in his image have the same inherent rights regardless of sex, race or colour. Men should strive to give God absolute obedience in all their thoughts and actions but also to accord to all men the respect due as creatures made in God's image.

 > Mt 22:35-40; Jn 15:17; Gal 3:28; 1Jn 4:19-21


We believe that good works are the fruit of faith in Jesus Christ but that works cannot save us from our sin nor from God's judgement. As expressions of Christian faith and love, our good works performed with reverence and humility are both acceptable and pleasing to God. Good works do not earn God's grace.

 > Mt 5:16; 7:16-20; Ro 3:27-28; Eph 2:10; 2Ti 1:8-9; Titus 3:5


## Salvation

We believe that Christ offered once and for all the one perfect sacrifice for the sin of the world. No other sacrifice for sin is necessary; none other can atone

 > Lk 24:46-48; Jn 3:16; Ac 4:12; Ro 5:8-11; Gal 2:16; 3:2-3; Eph 1:7-8; 2:13; Heb 9:11-14, 9:25-26; 10:8-14


We believe that a new life and a right relationship with God are made possible through the redemptive act of God in Jesus Christ. God, by his Spirit, acts to impart new life and put us into a relationship with himself as we repent and our faith responds to his grace. Justification, regeneration and adoption speak of entrance into and continuance in the new life.

 > Ps 32:1-2; Ex 36:26-27; Jn 1:12-13; 3:3-8; 5:24; Ac 10:43; 13:38-39; Ro 3:21-26; 3:28; 4:2-5; 5:8-11; 6:4; 8:15-17; 1Cor 6:11; 2Cor 5:17; 
 > Gal 4:4-7; Eph 1:5-6; 2:8-9; 4:22-24; Php 3:9; Col 3:9-10; Titus 3:4-5; 1Pe 1:23; 1Jn 3:1-3


We believe that the baptism of the Holy Spirit is effective from the time of the Christian's conversion as the Spirit dwells in every believer. We believe that sanctification is a continuing process in the life of the believer, having begun at conversion and to be completed when he meets the Lord. The Holy Spirit stirs the conscience and calls the Christian to repentance and holiness. As the believer responds in obedience and openness towards God the Spirit restores and empowers him to live an increasingly Christ-like and effective life. Every Christian should seek to be continually filled with the Holy Spirit and God responds to our willingness in this respect. On occasions, especially at times of crisis, God may dramatically affect the believer's life by the Holy Spirit's filling and presence.

 > Ac 10:44-49; 11:15-17; Ro 8:5-17; 8:23; 15:16; 1Cor 6:11; 12:13; Eph 5:18; 1Th 5:19-24; Heb 12:10-11


We believe that the Christian should live in a growing relationship with Jesus as Saviour and Lord. We recognise the fact that believers can fall into sin and thus grieve the Spirit. If this is the case he should humbly accept the correction of the Holy Spirit, seek the forgiveness of God and those he has wronged and trust in the advocacy of Jesus.

 > Mt 12:31-32; 18:21-22; Ro 6:1-4; Gal 6:1; 1Jn 1:5-10; 2:1-2; 5:16-17; Rev 2:5; 3:17-20


## The Church

We believe that the church is formed by God; it is the people of God. Christ Jesus is its Head; the Holy Spirit is its power. It is an organism, not an unchanging institution. It exists to fulfil the purposes of God in Christ. Christ loved the church and gave himself for it that it should be holy and without blemish. The church is the fellowship of the redeemed, preaching the Word of God and administering the ordinances according to Christ's instruction.

 > Mt 16:15-18; Ac 2:41-47; 9:31; 12:5; 15:22; 20:28; 1Cor 1:2; 12:12-28; Eph 1:22-23; 2:19-22; 3:9-10; 5:22-23; Col 1:18; 1Ti 3:14-15


We believe that all Christian men and women are equally valued by God and are enabled by him to undertake their individual ministries in response to his calling.

 > Gal 3:26-29; Ro 12:3-6


We believe that the only intermediary between the Christian and God is Jesus Christ and therefore we may approach him in prayer, with full assurance.

 > Heb 10:19-22; 1Pe 2:9-10


We believe that Baptism of believers and the Lord's Supper are the ordinances of the church commanded by Christ. By them, he works within us to quicken, strengthen and confirm our faith.

 > Mt 26:26-29; 28:19; Ac 22:16; 1Cor 10:16-17; 11:23-26; Gal 3:27


The baptism of believers by immersion is an ordinance of the church, commanded by our Lord, signifying their acceptance of the benefits of the atonement of Jesus Christ and their faith in him as Saviour. It is an act of identification with his death, burial and resurrection.

 > Mt 28:19; Ac 2:38; 2:41; 9:18; 16:33; 18:8; 19:5; 22:16; Gal 3:27-29; Col 2:11-12


The Lord's Supper is a remembrance of him and of our redemption by his death. We see the bread and the wine as symbols of Christ's body broken and his blood shed on our behalf at Calvary. All believers who come rightly and worthily are welcome to join with us in the remembrance of our Lord.

 > Mt 26:26-29; Mk 14:22-24; Jn 6:53-58; Ac 2:42; 1Cor 10:16-17; 11:23-34


## The Kingdom of God

We believe that the Kingdom of God is the sphere of Christ's rule, announced by Jesus during his earthly ministry. It is a growing reality today as God's reign is established in the hearts and lives of believers. The church, by its prayers, example and proclamation of the Gospel is the appointed instrument of God in his building of the Kingdom. The Kingdom is also future and is related to the return of Christ when judgement will fall upon the present order. The enemies of Christ will be subdued; the reign of God will be established; a new heaven and a new earth will be revealed and the hope of the redeemed will be fully realised.

 > Mt 6:10; 6:19-20; 24:14; Ac 1:8; Ro 8:19-23; 1Cor 15:20-25; Php 2:9-10; 1Th 4:15-17; 2 Th 1:5-12; 2Pe 3:3-10; Rev 21:3-8; 22:1-5; 22:17



## Jesus' Return

We believe that the return of Christ is certain and may occur at any moment. It is not given to us to know the hour. At his final return he will fulfil all the prophecies concerning his final triumph over evil. The believer's response is joyous expectation, watchfulness, readiness and diligence.

 > Mt 24:1-51; 26:64; Mk 13:26-27; Lk 17:26-37; Jn 14:1-3; Ac 1:9-11; 1Th 4:13-18; Titus 2:11-14; Heb 9:27-28; Rev 1:7; 19:11-16; 22:6-7; 22:12; 22:20


We believe in the bodily resurrection from the dead. The resurrection body will be a spiritual body but the person will be whole and identifiable. The resurrection of Christ is the guarantee of resurrection to life to those who are in him.

 > Jn 5:28-29; 1Cor 15:20; 15:51-57; 2Cor 4:13-14


We believe the eternal destiny of man is determined by God's grace and man's response, not by arbitrary decrees of God. We believe that God has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness. For those who trust him and obediently follow Jesus as Saviour and Lord there is a heaven of eternal glory and the blessedness of Christ's presence. But for the finally impenitent there is eternal suffering and separation from God in hell.

 > Mk 9:42-48; Jn 14:3; Heb 2:1-3; Rev 20:11-15; 21:22-27


## Christian Life

God gives assurance of salvation and peace of heart to all who repent and put their faith in him. The Holy Spirit witnesses to their own spirits that their sins are forgiven and that they are adopted into the family of God. The Christian has peace with God through Jesus Christ because his guilt is taken away and his fear of judgement is removed. God continues to give assurance to believers through the Scriptures, the conscious presence of the Holy Spirit, the love for and fellowship with other Christians.

 > Ro 5:1-2; 8:1; 8:16; Heb 10:19-25; 1Jn 3:14


Christians experience God's loving care and guidance as they trust and follow him. When they think that they are sufficient in themselves they become frustrated by trying to do for themselves what God wants to do for them. Self-sufficiency is inconsistent with perfect trust.

 > Eph 3:12; 1Ti 6:17


God calls his people to set themselves apart to his will and purpose. Christ demands that his disciples follow him in mind and spirit and be distinguished by love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.

 > Jn 13:15; Jn 14:15; Ro 6:13; 12:1; Gal 5:22-24


The Holy Spirit distributes, as he wills, gifts of speech and service devoted to the common good and the building up of the church. We believe that all the gifts described in the Scriptures are still given by the Holy Spirit but that the Word of God teaches that they should be used wisely in a decent and orderly manner. The believer should receive spiritual gifts gratefully and use them faithfully and responsibly in service. He must always ensure that his use of spiritual gifts is in accordance with the Scriptures. The gifts of the Spirit can only be properly manifested where there is the fruit of the Spirit. Every gift is to be exercised with the love and compassion of Christ. Unkind critical attitudes and schism in the church are evidences of the flesh.

 > 1Cor 12:4-11; 1Cor 12:28-31; 1Cor 14; Gal 5:13-26; 1Pe 4:10-11


The Bible must be taken seriously, read as a whole and studied for meaning. God will speak to the Christian through its pages if he is listening. The value and meaning of life are found in this book. The application of Scripture, in the power of the Holy Spirit, is a means of cleansing and changing attitudes and acts. Prayer is an indispensable means of growth toward Christ-likeness. In prayer the Christian talks and listens, confesses and adores, asks and thanks. Prayer must be immediate, sincere and without ritual. The Bible teaches that both individual and group prayer are effective for those who are in Christ. Prayer emphasises our dependence on God. Both prayer and Bible study should be regular but without becoming mere rituals.

 > Ps 119:11; 119:105; 119:65-72; 2Ti 3:14-17


We believe that God calls the Christian to fast in times of repentance, crisis, intercession and decision but that this must be a matter between himself and the Lord, without ritual or show.

 > Da 10:2; Ne 1:4; Mt 6:16-18; Ac 13:1-3; Ac 14:23


The Christian should regard all his material possessions as the property of God entrusted to him as a steward. He should not seek to acquire treasures on earth selfishly but should give liberally for the needs of others, for the ministry of the church and for missionary endeavour. His giving should be in secret.

 > Mt 6:1-4; Mt 6:19-20; Lk 12:16-21; 2Cor 8:1-5; 2Cor 9:6-13


We believe that from the beginning God intended for mankind's good that marriage should be a lifelong union of a man and a woman. This abiding union is used in Scripture to illustrate the holy relationship between Christ and his church. Scripture teaches that a Christian should not marry an unbeliever.

 > Mk 10:6-9; Eph 5:23-33; 2Cor 6:14-18


## Fellowship and the Local Church

We believe that God has ordained that Christians should meet together regularly for teaching, fellowship, breaking of bread and prayer. Corporate worship should be joyful and free but with a sense of reverence and at all times orderly. The presence of the Lord should be welcomed and recognised at all gatherings of Christians. The church must always ensure that the public use of spiritual gifts is in accordance with Scripture.

 > Ac 2:42-47; 1Cor 14:26-40; Php 4:4; Heb 12:28-29


The believer should seek to support his fellow Christians in practical ways, in caring and in prayer. Where appropriate, he should offer faithful advice and constructive criticism. He should be prepared to give, and if necessary to receive, gentle correction in case of error.

 > Ac 2:44-45; Ac 4:32-35; Gal 6:1-6; Jas 5:13-20


We do not approve of members of the church separating, divorcing and re-marrying except in those cases which accord with the counsel of the Word of God.

 > Mt 5:31-32; Mt 19:3-11; Mk 10:11-12; Lk 16:18; 1Cor 7:10-13; 1Cor 7:15-16


The church must seek reconciliation and restoration in all situations. We believe that when a person is saved he is a new creation therefore those who have been divorced on other than scriptural grounds prior to their conversion shall not for that reason be barred from membership or holding office in the church, even though they are re-married.

 > 2Cor 5:16-21


We believe that the public criticism of denominations, local churches or individuals is offensive and dishonouring to our Lord, in whose name and presence we meet.

 > Ac 15:1-11; 1Cor 3:1-9


We believe that co-operation with other local evangelical churches who hold to a similar basis of faith is both beneficial and has its example in Scripture.

 > Ac 15:22; Ac 15:30-35
