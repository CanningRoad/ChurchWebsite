![You're invited to Alpha](/photo/alpha1.jpg)

## What is it? ##

Alpha is an opportunity to explore life and the Christian faith in a friendly, open and informal environment.

Each session includes food, a short talk and a discussion where you can share your thoughts. There's no pressure, no follow up and no charge.


## Who's it for? ##

Any over 18s seeking answers and purpose in life! Sorry, but the kids will need to stay home for this one.


## When and where? ##

We are starting on **Monday 29th April** at **7pm**, and it will run every Monday night at the same time for 12 weeks.

We'll be using the Newton-street side of the building so you'll come in that way.
