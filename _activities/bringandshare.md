Our Bring & Share picnic is a regular event which happens {{page.when}}. We get together straight after church, put out what we've brought, and we all share, eat, chat, and enjoy! Everyone is welcome and we love to invite new people to come and join us for this community lunch.

## Is it for me?

Yes it is! Everyone is welcome. You can come to our [morning family service][ms] which happens immediately beforehand but you don't have to! You can come for the start of the lunch and be very welcomed. We sit at round tables in groups of 4 to 6 people. There are about 5 tables.

## How does it work?

 1. Buy or find some lunch food, like sandwiches, pasties, pizza, or even something fancier
 2. Bring it with you
 3. Pop it on the long sharing table
 4. Find a table to sit at
 5. After we've said a quick prayer of thanks, take a plate of food, tuck in and enjoy!
 
## Special Dietary Needs

If you have special dietary needs, bring some food you know you can eat and keep it back for yourself instead of putting it out on the sharing table. We understand!

## Can't bring food

If you can't bring anything along to share, that's ok! There is enough to go around from what the rest of us will bring.

## See you soon!

If you have questions, connect with us on [Twitter][twitter] or [Facebook][facebook] or come along to see us on a Sunday morning.
